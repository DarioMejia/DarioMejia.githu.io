                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Systems Engineering student fascinated with Data Science. I am passionate about coding and a self-motivated hard worker.
                    I have experience in creating Dashboards (Plotly/Dash) for Exploratory Data Analysis, data regression, and classification models 
                    to implement solutions to business problems, as well as text-data mining for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
                    My skill set includes programming languages such as Python, R, SQL, and Java, and I have strong analytical skills in Machine Learning, 
                    Deep Learning, NLP, and Advanced Statistics. I am eager to further my knowledge and skills as a Data Scientist in the IT domain.
